 + **Chandak, Anshuma：**
 + **Huang, Yuexuan：**  Built baseline model(GBM). Applied GBM with SIFT, HOG, Gray, PCA features. Modified the train.R, test.R and cross_validation.R files.
 + **Li, Xinrou：**
 + **Liu, Fangbing：** Created HOG feature and built SVM Linear model and SVM with RBF Kernel model and applied them to all the features. Also modified the train.R, test.R and cross_validation.R files. Created the summary plots for the final result. And organized the GitHub folders.
 + **Yan, Xiuruo：** Created gray feature, color feature and built adaboost model and logistic model. Applied these two models with SIFT, HOG, Gray, PCA features. Modified the feature.R, train.R, test.R and main.Rmd files.
